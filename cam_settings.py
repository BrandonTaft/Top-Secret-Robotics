# Note: some settings only affect the preview and not the captured image, some affect only the captured image, and many others affect both.

# Set the image resolution
# You can change the resolution of the image that the Camera Module takes.

# By default, the image resolution is set to the resolution of your monitor. The maximum resolution is 2592×1944 for still photos, and 1920×1080 for video recording.

# Use the following code to set the resolution to maximum and take a picture.

# Note: you also need to set the frame rate to 15 to enable this maximum resolution.

# camera.resolution = (2592, 1944)
# camera.framerate = 15
# camera.start_preview()
# sleep(5)
# camera.capture('/home/pi/Desktop/max.jpg')
# camera.stop_preview()
# The minimum resolution is 64×64.

# Try taking a picture with the minimum resolution.
# Add text to your image
# You can add text to your image using the command annotate_text.

# Run this code to try it:

# camera.start_preview()
# camera.annotate_text = "Hello world!"
# sleep(5)
# camera.capture('/home/pi/Desktop/text.jpg')
# camera.stop_preview()
# Change the look of the added text
# Set the text size with the following code:

# camera.annotate_text_size = 50
# You can set the text size to anything between 6 to 160. The default size is 32.

# It’s also possible to change the text colour.

# First of all, add Color to your import line at the top of the program:

# from picamera import PiCamera, Color
# Then below the import line, amend the rest of your code so it looks like this:

# camera.start_preview()
# camera.annotate_background = Color('blue')
# camera.annotate_foreground = Color('yellow')
# camera.annotate_text = " Hello world "
# sleep(5)
# camera.stop_preview()
# Change the brightness of the preview
# You can change how bright the preview appears. The default brightness is 50, and you can set it to any value between 0 and 100.

# Run the following code to try this out:

# camera.start_preview()
# camera.brightness = 70
# sleep(5)
# camera.capture('/home/pi/Desktop/bright.jpg')
# camera.stop_preview()
# The following loop adjusts the brightness and also adds text to display the current brightness level:

# camera.start_preview()
# for i in range(100):
#     camera.annotate_text = "Brightness: %s" % i
#     camera.brightness = i
#     sleep(0.1)
# camera.stop_preview()
# Change the contrast of the preview
# Similarly to the preview brightness, you can change the contrast of the preview.

# Run the following code to try this out:

# camera.start_preview()
# for i in range(100):
#     camera.annotate_text = "Contrast: %s" % i
#     camera.contrast = i
#     sleep(0.1)
# camera.stop_preview()
# Add cool image effects
# You can use camera.image_effect to apply a particular image effect.

# The image effect options are:

# none
# negative
# solarize
# sketch
# denoise
# emboss
# oilpaint
# hatch
# gpen
# pastel
# watercolor
# film
# blur
# saturation
# colorswap
# washedout
# posterise
# colorpoint
# colorbalance
# cartoon
# deinterlace1
# deinterlace2

#****The default effect is none.


# Pick an image effect and try it out:

# camera.start_preview()
# camera.image_effect = 'colorswap'
# sleep(5)
# camera.capture('/home/pi/Desktop/colorswap.jpg')
# camera.stop_preview()
# Run this code to loop over all the image effects with camera.IMAGE_EFFECTS:

# camera.start_preview()
# for effect in camera.IMAGE_EFFECTS:
#     camera.image_effect = effect
#     camera.annotate_text = "Effect: %s" % effect
#     sleep(5)
# camera.stop_preview()

# Set the image exposure mode
# You can use camera.exposure_mode to set the exposure to a particular mode.

# The exposure mode options are:

# off
# auto
# night
# nightpreview
# backlight
# spotlight
# sports
# snow
# beach
# verylong
# fixedfps
# antishake
# fireworks
# The default mode is auto.

# Pick an exposure mode and try it out:

# camera.start_preview()
# camera.exposure_mode = 'beach'
# sleep(5)
# camera.capture('/home/pi/Desktop/beach.jpg')
# camera.stop_preview()
# You can loop over all the exposure modes with camera.EXPOSURE_MODES, like you did for the image effects.

# Change the image white balance
# You can use camera.awb_mode to set the auto white balance to a preset mode.

# The available auto white balance modes are:

# off
# auto
# sunlight
# cloudy
# shade
# tungsten
# fluorescent
# incandescent
# flash
# horizon
# The default is auto.

# Pick an auto white balance mode and try it out:

# camera.start_preview()
# camera.awb_mode = 'sunlight'
# sleep(5)
# camera.capture('/home/pi/Desktop/sunlight.jpg')
# camera.stop_preview()
# You can loop over all the auto white balance modes with camera.AWB_MODES, like you did for the image effects.
